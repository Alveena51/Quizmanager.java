 
The Quiz Management System is a comprehensive application designed to facilitate the management of quizzes and student information. This system offers two primary interfaces: the Admin Panel and the Student Panel.

Administrators can add new students, view student details, and manage student information including names, passwords, email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers. The system ensures data integrity by validating email and phone number formats.

Students access their panel by authenticating with a username and password. Once logged in, they can view and attempt quizzes in subjects like General Knowledge, English, Mathematics, and Java. 

Each quiz involves a series of questions presented in random order, and the system checks and provides immediate feedback on the answers.

The system also maintains student records securely, allowing administrators to view detailed student information and transcripts. The use of file reading and writing operations ensures that student data is persistently stored and easily retrievable. 

Overall, this Quiz Management System provides a user-friendly interface for both administrators and students, streamlining the quiz administration process and enhancing the educational experience through structured data management and assessment tools.
